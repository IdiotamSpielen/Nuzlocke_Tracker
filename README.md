# Pokémon Nuzlocke Tracker

## description

This Pokémon Nuzlocke Tracker is an application designed to assist players in managing and tracking Nuzlocke runs across the main-line Pokémon games.  
Recognizing that extended play sessions are often difficult to schedule, this tool aims to provide a convenient way to record run progress, encountered Pokémon, team compositions, and achievements.  
This project utilizes Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM) to target both Android and iOS devices from a shared codebase.

This project is **Free and Open Source**, meaning the source code is publicly available and can be used, modified, and distributed under the terms of the **GNU General Public License version 3 only** (GPLv3).

## motivation

Balancing a full-time job with Nuzlocke playthroughs can be challenging.  
Maintaining consistent progress across multiple short sessions requires a reliable tracking method.  
Previously, I relied on an app that has since been removed from app stores, and its data was lost during a phone migration.  
This project aims to recreate and enhance that functionality, providing a more robust and future-proof solution for tracking Nuzlocke runs.

## intended functionalities:

### core

1. Tracking encounters, wether they were caught or escaped.
2. premade and custom encounters.
3. A page for the current team composition, the PC and the graveyard
4. a screen to keep track of badges and game completion.
5. support up to at least gen 5
6. managing multiple saves

### secondary (low priority, optional)

1. images for pokemon
2. detailed pokemon info
3. move editor
4. damage calculator
5. support up to and beyond the recently anounced gen 10
